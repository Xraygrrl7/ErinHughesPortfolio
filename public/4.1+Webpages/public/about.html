<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Erin!

  I’ve always loved diving into challenges—whether it’s exploring the underwater world as a scuba diver, perfecting a new recipe in the kitchen, or learning something completely outside my comfort zone. Over the past year, I’ve channeled that curiosity into a new passion: coding and design.</p>

<p>Before diving into tech, I spent more than 20 years in healthcare as an X-Ray technologist. I specialized in cardiac cath lab, interventional radiology, and neuro intervention, and later worked as a clinical application specialist and national clinical specialist in the healthcare industry. These roles taught me to think critically, solve problems creatively, and support others—skills I’ve found translate seamlessly into web development and UX/UI design.

<p>In 2023, I moved to the Netherlands and decided to take some time to adapt to my new surroundings and explore my next steps. That’s when I discovered my passion for creating digital experiences. I completed a UX/UI Bootcamp with Memorisely and am now tackling a Web Development Bootcamp through The App Brewery. With each project, I’ve been learning how to bring thoughtful, user-focused designs to life with clean, functional code.</p>
<p>What motivates me most is the chance to combine creativity with problem-solving. Whether it’s building a responsive website, designing intuitive interfaces, or troubleshooting code, I love the process of turning ideas into something tangible.</p>

<p>When I’m not coding, you can find me walking my dog, stargazing, or planning my next scuba diving adventure. I’m excited to continue growing as a developer and designer and can’t wait to see where this journey takes me.</p>
