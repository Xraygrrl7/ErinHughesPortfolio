<h1>Erin's Favorite Movies</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Twister</h3>
   <p>I love watching storms and this is the ultimate storm movie. There is nothing like watching storm chasers in action.</p>
<h3>Some Like It Hot</h3>
   <p>Marilyn Monroe movies are always great, but this movie with Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon dressed as women is super funny.</p>
<h3>The Wizard of Oz</h3>
   <p>There's no place like home...who doesn't love this classic fantasy movie. I used to watch this at night when I couldn't sleep.</p>
